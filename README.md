Ruhrpott is a proof-of-concept website built to demonstrate the use of structured content in a static website created with the [Metalsmith Static Site Generator](https://metalsmith.io). The [Sanity content management system](https://www.sanity.io/) is a perfect match to achieve this objective.

I did not want to use greek text and boring images, so I turned to the place of my youth for inspiration, the Ruhrpott. The photos and text tell little stories about where I grew up, and the website structure and design methodology are all about Metalsmith, Sanity, and structured content.

Most images used on this website are by [Daniel Mennerich](https://www.flickr.com/photos/danielmennerich/), who makes his art available on Flickr under a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/) license.

The website is meant for devs who like to explore Metalsmith in general and a Sanity integration in particular.

The blog section of this website includes several posts that provide an overview of essential implementation details. I used hero's of mine, for placeholder authors. They did not write the blogposts, they are all dead... just saying in case that wasn't clear.
